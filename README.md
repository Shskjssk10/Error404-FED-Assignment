Create a website where users can come to play retro arcade games when they are bored, whether is it while waiting for lessons in a library or drinking coffee in a cafe. 

The website will have 2 games: Snake Game and Pong Game, where Pong Game will be a 2 player game. Each game will have an instructions page and a page for the user to play. There will also be a leaderboard featured to show the highest scoring players of the website.

## Design Process

When coming up of the idea, we intended to design a website made for students. As students, we love games, so we decided to fall back on some classic retro games known to everyone, where you are an avid gamer or not. 

Since we decided to go with retro games, we deciede that the website should have some retro feel to it, while also being a modern website. This can be seen with the very arcade-feel type of fonts that we implemented. The background would also be of a dark color since arcades did have dark, usually black, backgrounds. The link to our wireframe will be attached at the bottom:

## Features 

The following are some features the websites have:

- Instructions page - Allow users to learn the game before playing should they not know
- Leaderboard - Allow users to view other top-scoring users to give a sense of competition
- Review section - Allow users to send any feedback regarding glitches or bugs, also for any future game recommendations that we can implement
- Games database - Showcase the other games that users might find interesting and take them to the page to find out more about the game

Some additional features we could also implement are: 
- Allow for users to play 2 player games on different devices
